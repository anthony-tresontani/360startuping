360startuping
=============

I need to improve. Startuping is about learning quickly and I am getting slow. By recording my progress, I should be able to get a better learner.


Day 0 - 28/12/2014
------------------

I have been startuping for 583 days on 6 differents projects. I learn a lot but I still haven't achieved anything meaningful.
Many back and forth steps. I am now working on Relink for about 6 months. We got some initial traction, everyone love it and we got some talented and dedicated people in the team.
I am mainly working on my prototype. I have got something decent and we got some priceless insights about what would be the main criteria for this product to great.
Stability, robustness, design, etc.

We also have a community. We like to say it's composed of 1700 people on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, google+ and in our weekly digest. That doesn't mean much.
For around a month now, it is hard to keep the same growth pace. We got only 17% more people last month. Our target is 50%.

Lately, it's been hard to find the way to go and I lost focus.

I believe I now know what has to be done first thanks to a great read about hardware startup https://medium.com/@BoltVC/hardware-by-the-numbers-part-1-team-prototyping-b225a33f55bf

Now I will be back on getting some tractions, real traction by getting people feedback.

*focus*: prototype

Day 1 - 29/12/2014
------------------

I had a look at our statistics and change the way to manage them. They are now weekly instead of daily and the main focus is on the number of people registering to the Relink newsletter. I also noticed the traffic didn't change much in volume but we got some referral from some low end website which give us near to zero conversion rate.

I spend most of my day buy new stuffs and setting them up and trying them. I now have a scroll saw to make new prototypes. While this might be seen a step back compared to laser cutting, it gives some new perspectives. Angle cut, faster iterations, etc.

I wrote a questionnaire few days ago and I have been reviewed the result today. Everyone (13 people) love it but in reality, most people don't read it (opening rate around 25%, read rate 8%). I still don't know if we would keep that much longer.

The development is going well. The remote control mechanism is partially working (no security) thanks to the great work done by Trajche.

My focus stay on the prototype for now as I believe it would allow to show many people and get some interesting feedback when we would have something interesting.


Day 2 - 30/12/2014
------------------

The morning has been spent working on the wood prototype. I got a bit better with the scroll saw and manage, with the help of some sanding, to do something not bad. I decided to try to also work on a plastic prototype. The wood prototype would help to do the mold and it will be casted with a black resin. The other part of the day has been focused on getting everything required for the casting, to try my new magnets and to add some polish to my half completed prototype.

Nothing ground breaking. The day has been quite short as tomorrow is new year eve.
