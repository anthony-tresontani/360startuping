=============

I need to improve. Startuping is about learning quickly and I am getting slow. By recording my progress, I should be able to get a better learner.


Day 0 - 28/12/2014
------------------

I have been startuping for 583 days on 6 differents projects. I learn a lot but I still haven't achieved anything meaningful.
Many back and forth steps. I am now working on Relink for about 6 months. We got some initial traction, everyone love it and we got some talented and dedicated people in the team.
I am mainly working on my prototype. I have got something decent and we got some priceless insights about what would be the main criteria for this product to great.
Stability, robustness, design, etc.

We also have a community. We like to say it's composed of 1700 people on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, google+ and in our weekly digest. That doesn't mean much.
For around a month now, it is hard to keep the same growth pace. We got only 17% more people last month. Our target is 50%.

Lately, it's been hard to find the way to go and I lost focus.

I believe I now know what has to be done first thanks to a great read about hardware startup https://medium.com/@BoltVC/hardware-by-the-numbers-part-1-team-prototyping-b225a33f55bf

Now I will be back on getting some tractions, real traction by getting people feedback.

*long term objective:* Getting some initial 'customer'
*short term objective:* finish the prototype
